![alt text](docs/img/slurm_proxy_title.svg)

SLURM CLI-API Proxy client is a tool designed to bridge existing applications and scripts that rely on the SLURM CLI. The tool mimics a selection of SLURM CLI commands, translating them into REST API calls, enabling seamless integration of existing tools with external SLURM workload managers. 

Due to the extensive range of optional SLURM command arguments, only a limited subset is supported. However, the tool is designed for flexibilityâ€”the support to new arguments can be easily enabled by mapping them to the corresponding API request parameters or payload properties (the documentation on how to do this is a work in progress).


## Setup and usage

### Requirement
- Linux, MacOS or [Windows with WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)
- Python version â‰¥3.10

### Installation 

```shell
# Check python version (requiring â‰¥3.10)
python --version

# Create a new virtual environment
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

# install 
pip install .

```

A virtual environment is *required* to install the the non-pypi dependencies. You can also use `conda` to manage python environments. If running from a shell terminal, the virtual environment where the package was installed must be active on it.

### Usage from a shell terminal

1. Define the URI of the target SLURM API through the `PROXY_SLURM_API_URL` environment variable:

```shell
#Example:
export PROXY_SLURM_API_URL=http://slurm-controller:6820
```

2. Set the SLURM_JWT environment variable with the API token of the target SLURM API. An script is provided to do this if you have ssh access to the SLURM workload manager:

```shell
#source update_token.sh <ssh-user> <wlm-host>
source update_token.sh userx slurm-controller
```

3. Run slurm commands as you would do* with the real ones:

```shell

#sbatch help
sbatch --help

#request a job
sbatch --job-name jobx --chdir /home/userx  tests/slurm_test_scripts/slurm_write_job.sh

squeue --json

```

ðŸš§ Alpha release notice* ðŸš§

- Only `sbatch` and `squeue` commands have been implemented
- Core functionality of these commands is present but may be incomplete
- Documentation and testing coverage are ongoing
- APIs and interfaces may change without notice
- Performance optimizations are still in progress

If you encounter issues or have feedback, please report them through the project's issue tracker.
